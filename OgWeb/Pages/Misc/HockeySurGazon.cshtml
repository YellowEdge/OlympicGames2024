                    <h4>
                        <p>The roots of hockey – which takes its name from the French word “hocquet”, meaning shepherd’s hook in reference to the shape of the stick – lie deep in antiquity. Historical evidence suggests that a crude form of the sport was played 4,000 years ago in Egypt and ancient variations played in Ethiopia (1000 BC) and Iran (2000 BC). -VS.).</p>
                        <p>Modern hockey emerged in England in the mid-19th century and is largely attributed to the growth of private schools, such as Eton. The first hockey federation was established in the United Kingdom in 1876 and established the first formal set of rules for the game.</p>
                        <p>Hockey appeared for the first time at the Games in 1908, in London. It made its definitive entry into the Olympic program in 1928, in Amsterdam. Women entered the program in 1980, at the Moscow Games.</p>

                        <p>Speed, technicality, fun! These are the main characteristics of hockey, an exhilarating and very dynamic sport, to which should be added endurance and great coordination. A hockey match is played eleven against eleven and lasts 60 minutes. It consists of 4 periods of 15 minutes. On the field, each team has ten outfield players in the position of attackers, midfielders and defenders as well as a goalkeeper. Each player can be replaced at any time and as often as desired. A team can choose to play without a goalkeeper (temporarily, in principle). In direct elimination matches, a shootout session decides between the tied teams at the end of regulation time.</p>
                        <p>If at the beginning of this sport, the grass was natural, it slowed down the game. The choice of synthetic turf was made to make the game faster and more modern. The pitch is also wet, which accelerates the movement of the ball even more.</p>
