                    <h4>
                        <p>Skateboarding is a young and spectacular sport, which developed in the United States in the 1950s, while surf culture was also taking off in the country. Skateboarding is part of the alternative underground culture of the 1980s, around values of freedom, rebellion and the constant search for adrenaline. His practice developed and became more popular in the early 2000s and met with great success among young people.</p>
                        <p>After making its big debut on the Olympic scene at the Nanjing Youth Olympic Games in 2014, skateboarding is moving up a gear and arriving at the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2021 as a “new sport”. Skateboarding is also one of the four additional sports of Paris 2024, and will undoubtedly ignite the Place de la Concorde, transformed into a sports arena for the occasion.</p>

                    <h4>
                        <p>The elite of world skateboarding will compete at the Olympic Games in two of the most popular and spectacular skateboarding disciplines, Park and Street, where athletes will have to perform the most beautiful tricks, meeting criteria of technique, speed or still amplitude of their figures.</p>
                        <p>The events will consist of two rounds, a preliminary qualifying round, then a final round.</p>
                        <p>The Park takes place in a varied terrain, combining bowls and numerous curves used by athletes to gain speed or take flight to perform sequences of figures.</p>
                        <p>In this discipline, the height and speed of performing figures during jumps are evaluated, as well as the skaters' ability to use the entire surface and its roughness. Athletes are scored on three forty-five second runs. The best passage is retained to define the final ranking.</p>
                        <p>Street takes place in a setting reproducing the elements of a street, such as stairs, rails... just like the original playground of skateboarders. Athletes must perform a series of tricks, and are also judged on their ability to master their board during the two forty-five-second runs and five tricks performed.</p>
